# Feature Specs

This folder is the staging area for new and planned features.

Process:
1) Describe each new feature in `features/*.md` before implementation.
2) Implement and validate in code/tests.
3) Transfer finalized behavior and run instructions to `docs/*`.

Recommended spec template:
1) Problem / goal.
2) Scope (in / out).
3) Proposed architecture.
4) Step-by-step execution logic.
5) Open questions.
6) Acceptance criteria.
